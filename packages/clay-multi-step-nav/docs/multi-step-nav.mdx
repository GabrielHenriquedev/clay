It's used when a major or big task has to be divided into smaller task, with the aim of letting the user breath in the process and providing them with a sense of progression.

Each step can have two different states: `active` or `complete` defined by props as you can see below.

<MultiStepNav />

## Indicator position

Some use cases don't need the title or subtitle to add context to the steps, in those cases you might just want the label to be rendered to the `top` of the indicator, so it can truncate the text if it is long.

```jsx
<ClayMultiStepNav indicatorLabel="top">
	<ClayMultiStepNav.Item
		active={active}
		complete={complete}
		expand={i + 1 !== steps.length}
		key={i}
	>
		<ClayMultiStepNav.Divider />
		<ClayMultiStepNav.Indicator
			complete={complete}
			label={1 + i}
			onClick={onClick}
			subTitle={label}
		/>
	</ClayMultiStepNav.Item>
</ClayMultiStepNav>
```

## Collapsable Steps

Using `ClayMultiStepNavWithBasicItems` in combination with `maxStepsShown` prop you can collapse the steps that don't fit into a dropdown to ensure good user experience.
